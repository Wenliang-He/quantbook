### what's Git & GitHub

Git is a *version control* system. Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a *repository* – in a sane, highly structured way.

GitHub provides a home for your Git-based projects on the internet.

### Connect Git, GitHub, Rstudio

Objective: make sure that you can pull from and push to GitHub from your computer.

#### introduce yourself to Git

In the shell (Git Bash) print the following code:

git config --global user.name 'Jennifer Bryan'
git config --global user.email 'jenny@stat.ubc.ca'
git config --global --list

substituting your name and the email associated with your GitHub account.
